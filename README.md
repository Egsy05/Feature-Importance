Here's where I save my work from dibimbing for Feature Importance and how to understand behind Machine Learning Work

In here I only use Logistic Regression, Tree Base Models, and Light Gradient Boosting for the ML

Also this is a simulation if my boss need a model to predict churn and understand about why there is churn and how do we understand about the process behind predicting churn wtih the model
